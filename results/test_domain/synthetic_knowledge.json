Backlinko’s authority score is 60, and has a healthy backlink profile. Why does this matter? We can outrank MailChimp, Semrush, and Moz for the highly competitive !( \"google-serp-what-are-backlinks\") To increase your authority, you need to understand your score. So, we’ve created a free tool powered by Semrush so you can access enough data to develop a plan. This guide will delve into the subtleties of website authority. It’ll also cover the reporting methods of various tools and strategies to boost your website’s reputation for increased traffic. ## What Is Website Authority? Website authority measures how likely a site is to rank in Sounds great, right? It is. And it’s part of the reason SEO professionals have been captivated by website authority since the idea was first teased in a 1999 re Your site’s PageRank score could significantly influence Google Matt Cutts, the former Head of Google’s webspam team, explained more in a [2009 blog post: !( > Probably the most popular way to envision PageRank is as a flow that happens between documents across outlinks. !( But he also cautioned against page-sculpting, or “trying to change how PageRank flows within your site using “nofollow” attributes. !( > I would let PageRank flow freely within your site. The notion of “PageRank sculpting” has always been a second – or third – order recommendation for us. Pay attention to 1) making great content that will attract links in the first place and 2) choosing a site architecture that makes your site usable for humans and !( Even with this guidance, it prompted SEOs to create entire plans around improving PageRank. But there was a problem. No one knew exactly what went into Google’s PageRank calculations. They had ideas, but Google didn’t share this info. It was a secret sauce. Google’s mysterious PageRank algorithms led to the invention of the domain authority score. This scoring system allows SEOs to calculate, monitor, and influence website authority. It’s the SEO industry’s best attempt to replicate PageRank. ## Why Does Website Authority Matter so Much in SEO? Website authority is critical to securing the top rankings in your niche. Google needs to know your website is trustworthy before surfacing your pages high in the SERPs. You’ll have difficulty outranking your competitors if their authority scores are much higher than yours. It’s also why brand-new websites with no link history and little content struggle to get traffic. Let’s compare the two sites for context. When !( \"google-serp-keto-chicken-breast-recipes\") The Big Man’s World is the first rich snippet The site has a Semrush Authority Score of 59. Eat Well 101 also appears in the SERPs. While it doesn’t have a rich snippet, it’s in the first 10 results. !( \"semrush-domain-overview-eatwell101\") Eat Well101 has a Semrush authority score of 41. This is lower than the score of Wholesomeyum.com, which is 60. This may indicate that Wholesomeyum.com would show up higher in some results. But are there exceptions? And does age matter at all? We 1. Teaching Expertise 2. Crayola As a brand that’s been around for 100+ years (with a well-established website), Crayola unsurprisingly has the highest Authority Score (68). !( \"semrush-domain-overview-crayola\") But Teaching Expertise ranked higher on the SERP with its Authority Score of 47. It showed up well before Crayola for the !( \"semrush-domain-overview-teachingexpertise\") What does this tell us? While website authority does matter and can correlate with higher SERP placement, it’s not the only factor. Google also considers other things, like how useful the content is and how users interact with it. Google wants to know that the content is relevant and delivers on promises. It’s only fair. A website having higher authority doesn’t mean it provides more helpful content for ## Defining Website Authority Metrics For Semrush, Ahrefs & Moz The top three website authority ranking tools are Semrush, Ahrefs, and Moz. Although each tool uses a unique algorithm, they strive to be the most accurate. Why? For one, it helps them to be an authority in the field of SEO. They also want to stand out from the pack with a tool that offers something slightly different. Like Google’s algorithms, their algorithms aren’t completely transparent, but we know how they prioritize general metrics. Here’s how they stack up: * **Semrush Authority Score (AS):** Semrush’s Authority Score stands out for its dedication to mitigating unfair ranking practices. The tool may show a more authentic representation of the site’s link influence. * **Ahrefs Domain Rating (DR):** Ahrefs has added new SEO features to complement its DR algorithm and make it more competitive. But, with a smaller link index may not show all of a site’s inbound links. * **Moz Domain Authority (DA):** Moz is a great tool with a “first to market” reputation. It’ll continue to be a top contender, even without some of the manipulation mitigation tactics that Semrush uses. You can see how each tool handles the website authority for Backlinko.com in this table: | Website Authority Tool | Backlinko.com Rating | | --- | --- | | Semrush Authority Score | 60 | | Ahrefs Domain Rating | 90 | | Moz Domain Authority Score | 72 | Now, let’s talk a bit more about what goes into creating these scores. ### Semrush: Authority Score (AS) Authority Score is Semrush’s proprietary ranking metric, updated in 2023 to be more resistant to manipulation. Why is manipulation even a problem? Around the time domain authority became relevant, companies popped up claiming to help boost authority scores. Semrush deemed it necessary to differentiate between websites with artificially inflated scores and those with genuine authority. The ranking system goes from 0-100. In our Backlinko example, a score of 60 is considered to have a “great backlink profile and is niche relevant. A link from this domain would benefit your profile.” !Backlinko Authority Score **How it’s calculated** Semrush uses artificial intelligence (AI) to determine authority based on these metrics (weighted from highest to lowest): 1. Link power 2. Organic traffic 3. No organic rankings on SERPs 4. An unnaturally high % of dofollow domains 5. An imbalance between links and organic traffic 6. Too many referring domains with the same IP address 7. Too many referring domains with the same IP network 8. The presence of another domain with an identical backlink profile **Interpreting the score** Authority score claims to have no perfect scores and very few in the high 90s. It’s also more useful as a comparative tool without a binary “good” or “bad” label for the website. For example, how do all sneaker blogs compare? Which authority score is the highest? Semrush’s textual rating labels go beyond just a number and help translate what the scores mean in the real world. For instance, Backlinko’s score of 60 is “very good and niche relevant.” Other score labels may include things like “Poor traffic-to-backlink ratio” or “Heavy signs of spam,”–which can be just as useful as the numerical value. ### Ahrefs: Domain Rating (DR) Ahrefs has a publicly available ranking system that tracks just those domains in its database, measured by the size and quality of their backlinks. Its proprietary Domain Rating (DR) is a separate numerical value representing backlink strength compared to others. Like the others on our list, DR scores are between 0 and 100. Ahrefs clarifies that its score works on a “logarithmic scale” or that it’s harder to go from DR 70 to DR 71 than it is to go from DR 20 to 21. In other words, the better your score, the more difficult it is to improve. !( \"ahrefs-website-authority-checker-backlinko\") **Unveiling DR’s calculation** Ahrefs shares what it looks at to assign a rating. It’s all about the backlinks. First, it looks for sites with at least one referring link. Then, it counts the number of domains linking to the referring link. The final score is determined by the DR of the original referring link and the number of unique links out from that domain. **What’s a good DR?** The closer your DR is to 100, the more authority your website has. Because of the logarithmic scale, seeing a site with a high score go up even a point or two demonstrates more impressive gains than new sites with big leaps. Under this ranking system, Backlinko.com has a very high score of 90. Getting that up even a point or two higher would be rather difficult. ### Moz: Domain Authority (DA) Moz had one of the original SEO tools and was the first to coin Domain Authority (DA). It led the way for bigger and better ranking scores and proved that people care about this. **Factors affecting DA** Like the other tools, links are essential. How important? DA specifically looks at the total number of inbound links and the root domains of those links. It uses a dozen scoring factors, although it doesn’t specifically list them. Ultimately, it’s all about the links. The more, the better. **How the rating works** Let’s look again at our example of Backlinko.com. !( \"moz-domain-analysis-backlinko\") The site has a score of 72 and includes the linking authority from 62.4K root domains. By the way, these inbound links have a very low spam score of 4%. (This helps legitimize the authority score.) Like other tools, DA compares sites to one another and makes it more difficult for high-ranking sites to move up on the scale. Moz also uses machine learning (ML) technology to rank sites. We aren’t sure exactly what that entails (it’s a secret.) But we do know as the data points change, so will the ranking. An example they give is if Facebook were to acquire a billion new links, competing sites would drop. There isn’t infinite space for domains. If one climbs, others must decrease to compensate for the lost opportunities. There’s only so much authority to go around. #### Which website authority score is best? Three tools offer three very different approaches to scoring websites. With so much depending on a site’s reputation, we prefer Semrush’s rating system. It’s focused on keeping scores fair and unaffected by shady SEO practices. It also gives more than a numerical score; it offers insight into what makes up the score so you know what to work on. ## How to Increase Your Website Authority By earning more high-quality backlinks to your website, you’re doing much of the hard work to increase your score. Link building generally takes time, but it’s always a worthy endeavor. Start by doing a backlink audit It’s also possible to get results faster. Backlinko earned over 5,600 quality backlinks in 30 days. !( \"backlinko-last-month-backlinks\") We used the reverse outreach strategy to land links from Bloomberg, Inc. and Business Insider. Check out this case study to discover exactly how we did it. ## Website Authority Is Only a Guide: Do This Instead Many SEO professionals would have you believe that’s the only thing to aim for. But this thinking is limited and often focused on the wrong things. Remember, website authority numbers can reflect the things you’re already doing really well (or really bad) in creating a Google-friendly experience. In the end, though, only Google knows what will help you rank. Consider this: Google doesn’t even use the word “authority” in its guide. (Not convinced? Check it out here.

    "content": "Ahrefs. Backlink Checker metric from Moz. When we talk about domain authority, we’re talking about a general SEO concept that’s synonymous with “website authority.” Here at Ahrefs, we have a website authority metric of our own called Domain Rating. It runs on a scale from zero to a hundred. The higher a website’s Domain Rating (DR), the stronger and more authoritative it is. The free tool above shows your website’s “authority” as calculated by Ahrefs (i.e., Domain Rating). --- ## How we calculate our Domain Rating (DR) score Domain Rating (DR) looks at the quantity and quality of external backlinks to a website. Here’s how we calculate this metric in simple terms: 1. Look at how many unique domains link to the target website; 2. Look at the \"authority\" of those linking domains; 3. Take into account how many unique domains each of those sites link to; 4. Apply some math and coding magic to calculate “raw” DR scores; 5. Plot these scores on a 100-point scale Domain Rating doesn’t take into account any other variables like link spam, traffic, domain age, etc. Learn more about Domain Rating here and keyword rankings for 218,713 domains, we found that the two correlate well. !( This makes Domain Rating (authority) a useful metric by which to estimate a website’s ability to get organic traffic from Google. Disclaimer: This is a correlation study. It does not prove causation. --- ## What is a good Domain Rating (authority) score? Generally speaking, the higher the \"authority\" of your domain, the better. But it’s important not to judge Domain Rating in absolute terms. That’s because Domain Rating is a relative metric by definition. It’s not possible to say that a Domain Rating of 30 is good, or 50, or 60, or 70. It’s all relative. Here’s a general rule of thumb: Your Domain Rating (authority) is good if it’s higher than or comparable to similar sites. --- ## How to improve your Domain Rating (i.e., \"authority\" score) Getting backlinks from more unique websites (referring domains) is the only way to improve your website’s Domain Rating (authority) score. But improving your site’s \"authority\" should never be your primary goal. You should instead focus on earning backlinks from strong pages on reputable sites in your industry to the pages that you want to rank in Google. That’s because there’s a clear correlation between the number of referring domains to a page and the amount of organic traffic it gets. !( correlation between referring domains and Furthermore, we found that the number of referring domains to a page is the strongest correlating backlink factor as far as rankings are concerned. !( --- ## How to use “website authority” Here are two good uses cases: ### 1. Benchmarking against your competitors If your website \"authority\" is higher than that of your competitors, then your site is stronger than theirs in terms of \"link popularity.\" For example, ahrefs.com has a Domain Rating of 88. Moz.com has a Domain Rating of 91. That’s because it has more backlinks from websites with strong link profiles, which leads to a higher \"authority\" score (as measured by Ahrefs). TIP. If two websites have the same Domain Rating, then you should use Ahrefs Rank (AR) to judge their relative strength. Comparing your Domain Rating to other websites in your industry can tell you whether your competitors are doing better or worse than you. If they’re doing better, then you may want to analyze their backlink profile in Ahrefs Site Explorer for untapped link opportunities. ### 2. Vetting link prospects Google cares more about the \"strength\" of the linking page than that of the linking domain. Still, pages on high \"authority\" domains tend to be stronger than those on low \"authority\" sites. For that reason, Ahrefs’ Domain Rating is a good proxy by which to judge the relative quality of link prospects. Still, never judge the quality of a website on site-wide \"authority\" alone. You should also consider the following: * Do they have high-quality backlinks? * Do they have lots of pages? (fewer is usually better) * Do they link out to a lot of websites? (again, fewer tends to be better) * Are they publishing high-quality content? * Is this website likely to still be around in six months? A year? Five years? * Does it get any organic traffic? Is this website topically-relevant to yours? --- ## Link Building Guides !( Learn what website authority is, how Domain Rating (DR) is calculated and how to increase your score the right way. ![ 16 Raffles Quay, #33-03 Hong Leong Building, Singapore 048581",

I’ll also show you why link building is still important for SEO in 2025. Let’s get started. ## What Is Link Building? Link building is the practice of building one-way hyperlinks (also known as “backlinks And they were right. Nearly 20 years later, links are STILL the best way to determine the quality of a webpage. That’s why backlinks remain Google’s go-to ranking signal. That said, thanks to updates like Google Penguin. You might be wondering: What is a high-quality link, exactly? And how do I build them? That’s what I’m going to cover in the next chapter. Keep reading… ## **Chapter 2:**How to Find High-Quality Links !How To Find High Quality Links Before we dive into the step-by-step link building strategies, it’s important to know what makes a good (or bad) link. That way, you can focus on building links that will actually improve your Google rankings. With that, here’s how to identify links that are actually worth building: ## Authority of the Page Is the page linking to you a PageRank powerhouse? If so, that link is going to have a BIG impact on your In fact, from years of testing, **I’ve found that the authority of the page linking to you matters more than any other factor**. That’s because links from authoritative pages pass more authority (also known as PageRank (Note: Although Google doesn’t share PageRank information publicly, they still use it as the foundation of their algorithm using Semrush. Just pop a URL into Semrush and check out its “Authority Score”: !Domain Overview – backlinko.com – Authority Score ## Authority of the Site A link’s quality is also determined by a domain’s **sitewide authority**. In general, a link from a site like NYTimes.com will have a MUCH bigger impact than a link from a no-name blogger. While these links are tough to get, they’re well worth the effort. Again, Semrush comes in handy here. Enter a site root URL into the tool and check out its “Authority Score”. !Domain Overview – backlinko.com – Authority Score ## Relevancy of the Site When it comes to links, a site’s authority matters. But that site’s relevance also matters. For example, let’s say you run a website about The Paleo Diet. And you get a link from an authoritative site… about unicycles. Will that link still count? According to an interview from an ex-Googler Or is it buried in a page’s !Backlinko It turns out that your **link’s position on a page** is important. Specifically, links stashed away in Bottom line? You want your links to appear within the main body of a webpage. ## Is the Link Editorially Placed? No matter where your link appears on a page, you should ask yourself: “Was this link editorially placed?”. In other words, did someone link to you because they thought your site is awesome? If so, that’s an editorial link. Or did you create a profile on a random site and drop a link? That’s not an editorial link. As you might expect, Google puts MUCH more weight on [editorially-placed links is the clickable text section of a link. As it turns out, Google uses anchor text as a ranking signal. For example, let’s say you get a link to your site with anchor text: “paleo desserts”. !Anchor Links Google sees that anchor text and says: “Hmmm. That site used the anchor text: “paleo desserts”. The page they’re linking to must be about “paleo desserts.” Of course, like anything in SEO, keyword-rich anchor text has been abused. Today, building lots of exact-match anchor text links is considered spammy. Here’s an example of what I’m talking about: !Keyword rich anchor text In short, I don’t recommend building links with keyword-rich anchor text. But if you DO get a link with your keyword in the anchor text, it’s time to celebrate. ## Link Co-Occurrences Co-Occurrences are the words and phrases that appear around your link. Google likely uses This makes sense if you think about it: **The text around your link also gives clues to what your page is about**. So why wouldn’t Google use it? ## Is the Link From a Guest Post? A few years ago, Google came right out and said: !( > “So stick a fork in it: guest blogging is done; it’s just gotten too spammy.” > > – **Matt Cutts**, Former Head of Google’s Webspam Team !( Is that true? Well…it depends. Here are some red flags that can make guest posting spammy: * Someone is paid to publish the post * The post contains exact match anchor text * The site exists solely to publish guest posts * The site is unrelated to yours But what if you publish a mind-blowing guest post on an authoritative, relevant site? In my experience, that link CAN help you rank. ## Nofollow .vs. Dofollow *rel=”nofollow”* is a tag added to a link that tells Obviously, when it comes to SEO, you want to get normal, “dofollow” links whenever possible. Now that you can know how to size up a link’s quality, it’s time to start building them. ## **Chapter 3:**How to Get World-Class Links With Content Marketing ![Content Marketing Its no secret that content is the key that unlocks amazing backlinks. But here’s the deal: **Simply publishing content isn’t going to land you any links.** As it turns out, certain types of content work best for link building. And here are the 4 types of content that tend to generate the most links: ## #1: Visual Assets ### What It Is: Visual assets are: 1. Images 2. Diagrams 3. Infographics 4. Charts and other visual-oriented pieces of content ### Why It Works: Visuals are super-duper easy to link to. For example, when you publish a chart on your site, you get a link anytime someone shares that chart on their site. This powerful “share my image and link to me when you do” relationship simply doesn’t work for text-based content. ### Real-Life Example: A few years ago I published this visual about Google CTR on my site. !Google organic CTR – Breakdown by position To date, this visual has been linked to dozens of times (many of which came from authoritative sites in the marketing niche). Sure, some of these links would have come in even if I had listed the same data in a table. But a good chunk of these links (I’d estimate 75%) were created because I presented the info as a visual. In fact, lots of my links came from people directly posting my visual on their site (and linking back to me as the source): !( And the funny thing is, even though it’s been several years, people STILL link to my visual every month. That’s the power of creating visual assets. ## #2: List Posts ### What It Is: A numbered list of tips, techniques, reasons, myths…or just about anything. ### Why It Works: List posts pack a ton value into digestible, bite-sized chunks. In fact, when BuzzSumo analyzed 1 million articles ### Real-Life Example: This list post, 19 NEW SEO Techniques …and comments. !Backlinko post – Number of comments But most importantly, that post is a link magnet. It has over 5,000 links. !Backlink Analytics – backlinko.com – Backlinks And because the page has so many links pointing to it, it ranks in the top 3 for the keyword “SEO Techniques”. !Google SERP – SEO techniques ## #3: Original Re ### What It Is: Content that reveals new data from industry studies, surveys or original re ### Why It Works: Statistics and data are highly linkable. When someone cites your data, they link to you. These links add up QUICKLY. ### Real-Life Example: Some time ago, I published the largest Google ranking factors study ever ## #4: In-Depth Ultimate Guides ### What It Is: A comprehensive resource that covers everything there is to know about a given topic (and then some). ### Why It Works: Ultimate guides pack an insane amount of information in one place. This makes your guide THE go-to resource for that topic. ### Real-Life Example: I used to get emails from people asking me for copywriting advice on a daily basis. Unfortunately, I didn’t have anything on my blog that covered that super-important topic. So I created one: What is Copywriting? The Definitive Guide. !Backlinko – Copywriting – The Definitive Guide Because this multi-chapter guide covers copywriting like no other resource online, it’s been linked to **over 6 thousand** times. !Backlink Analytics – Copywriting guide – Backlinks Now that you’ve created a piece of link-worthy content, it’s time to build some relevant links. How? With good ol’ fashioned email outreach. ## **Chapter 4:**How to Build Powerful Links With Email Outreach !Email Outreach If you want to build white hat links in 2025 (and beyond), you need to use email outreach. The question is: How can you reach out to bloggers and journalists without ending up in their spam folder? Read this chapter to find out. 1 ### Find “Likely Linkers” As the name suggests, Likely Linkers are people that are likely to link to you. I’ll show you a bunch of techniques for finding Likely Linkers in Chapter 6. But for now, let’s use a simple strategy to identify them: **reverse engineering**. First, !Google SERP – Paleo desserts Grab the URL of the first result and pop it into a link analysis tool (I’m using Semrush in this example). Next, hit “Backlink Analytics” in the sidebar and then “Backlinks”: !Backlink Analytics & Backlinks – Arrows The sites listed here are all Likely Linkers. !Backlink Analytics – paleorunningmomma.com – Backlinks (How do you know which sites to target and which to ignore? Check out Chapter 2 But what if you want to reach out to a massive site? Combing through this list is going to be a pain. That’s why, in those cases, I recommend VoilaNorbert. ### VoilaNorbert Instead of popping in a URL, with VoilaNorbert.com That way you’re reaching out to the person that can actually add your link to their page. And it’ll show you that specific person’s email address. 3 ### Send Them a (Personalized) Script If you want to scale outreach, you’ll need to use scripts. The trick is to make your script not look like a script (more on that in the next step). But now, here’s an example of one of my best-performing email scripts: Hi First Name, I was looking for content on Topic today, when I stumbled on your article: Article Title. Good stuff! I especially enjoyed Something specific from their article. Also, I just published a new guide on Your Topic: URL. As someone that writes about Topic, I thought you’d enjoy it. My guide may also make a nice addition to your page. Either way, keep up the awesome work with Website! Talk Soon, Your Name Notice how the script allows A LOT of personalization without a whole lot of effort. ## **Chapter 5:**The Skinny On Black Hat Link Building (and Google Penalties) !Black Hat Links No guide to building links would be complete without a chapter on black hat SEO. Black hat link building is pretty easy to spot: If the links go against Google’s Webmaster Guidelines. But it’s up to you. That said, whether you’re a white hat or black hat So let’s briefly cover them: ## Google Penguin ### What It Is: An algorithmic penalty. ### How to Avoid It: Only build white hat links. There’s data to show that you can dodge Penguin by minimizing exact match anchor text. ## Manual Penalty Links ### What It Is: A manual penalty from someone at Google. Unlike Penguin, Google will send you a message via the Google ![Unnatural inbound links ### How To Avoid It: No one outside of Google knows how sites get targeted for manual penalties. My take is that an algorithm spots a website that’s potentially gaming the system. And they bubble that site up to someone at Google for a manual review. So the best way to avoid a manual penalty is to have a squeaky-clean link profile. Also, unlike with Penguin, you can recover from a manual penalty by disavowing links !Link Building Strategies No intro needed for this chapter. Here are 3 of my battle-tested strategies for building lots of quality backlinks: ## Resource Page Link Building First off: what are resource pages? Resource pages are pages that link out to awesome content on a given topic. Here’s an example: !( \"the-baking-plan\") Because **these pages exist for the sole purpose of linking out**, they make PERFECT link building targets. With that, here’s the step-by-step process: 1 ### Find Resource Pages Use these “Keyword” + inurl:links “Keyword” + “helpful resources” “Keyword” + “useful resources” “Keyword” + “useful links” 2 ### Size Up The Page Here’s where you (quickly) answer the question: “Is a link from this page worth the effort?”. (Hint: Use the tips from Chapter 2 to make this step a breeze.) For example, this resource page has a decent Authority Score of 42. Not bad. !Domain Overview – paleorunningmomma.com – Authority Score It’s also on an authoritative domain. And my link will end up somewhere on the body of the page. Looks like a winner! 3 ### Find “Best Fit” Content Look: You can bullish high-quality content… …but if it’s not a good fit for that resource page? You’re not gonna get a link. So for this step, find content on your site that’ll fit that resource page like a glove. Once you’ve ID’d that content, move onto step #4. 4 ### Send This Tested Script Here’s the script I recommend: **Subject: Question about Their Website** — Hi Name, I was Googling around for content about Topic this morning, when I came across your excellent resource page: URL. I just wanted to say that your page helped me a ton. I would have never found the Resource They Link To without it. It’s funny: I recently published a guide on Topic last month. It’s Brief Description. Here it is in case you’d like to check it out: URL. Also, my guide might make a nice addition to your page. Either way, thanks for putting together your list of resources. And have a great day! Talk Soon, Your Name !( > **Pro Tip:** Like all outreach scripts, make sure to personalize this script as much as possible. You can use a script as long as it doesn’t LOOK like a script. !( ## Broken Link Building Broken Link Building is one of my all-time favorite link building strategies. Why? Instead of straight-up begging for links, with Broken Link Building, **you add value to someone’s website**. Here’s how to do it: 1 ### Install Check My Links This tool quickly finds broken links on any page (from within your Chrome Browser). I’ll show you how to use them in a minute. !Check My Links – Chrome Web Store 2 ### Find Pages With Lots of Outbound Links The more links a page has, the more likely one of them will be broken. Resource pages work great here. So feel free to use the 3 ### Check For Broken Links Here’s where you run the extension you installed in the first step. They’ll reveal broken links on that page: !Check for broken links 4 ### Email The Site Owner About Their Broken Link Finally, let the person that runs that page about their broken link (or links),… and pitch content from your site as a replacement. Here’s the script I recommend: **Subject: Problem with Their Site’s Name** — Hi Name, Are you still updating your site? I was However, I noticed a few links didn’t seem to be working: URLs of broken links Also, I recently published Brief Content Pitch. It may make a good replacement for the Point Out a Specific Broken Link. Either way, I hope this helped you out 🙂 Thanks, Your Name ## The Skyscraper Technique This video will walk you through the step-by-step process: Once you watch the video, it’s time for the next chapter: Awesome link building case studies! ## **Chapter 7:**Incredible Case Studies !Incredible Case Studies Now it’s time for me to show you real-life examples of link building in action. The best part? **I’ve never shared any of these case studies before.** ## Case Study #1 ##### How Julie Used The Skyscraper Technique to Boost Organic Traffic By 194.1% --- Julie Adams’ blog, Our Beautiful Planet And instead of publishing this content and hoping for the best, Julie used email outreach to build backlinks. And this landed her a handful of links from authority sites in the science space: !Link from authority site These white hat backlinks boosted her organic traffic by a legit 194.1%: !White cap backlinks boosted post's organic traffic Why does The Skyscraper Technique work so well? According to Julie: > “The thing that makes this so successful is that it’s just as much about building relationships as it is about building links. People won’t link to your content unless they know it exists, and they won’t know it exists unless you tell them about it.” Well said. ## Case Study #2 ##### Broken Link Building Pays Off Last year I decided to run a broken link building campaign. So I followed the steps that I outlined in the last chapter. First, I used And I used Check My Links to find links that weren’t working. Then I emailed the person in charge of that content to give them a heads up about broken links that I found: !Brian's email about broken links (Note how uber-personalized that email is) When they replied, I sent them the URL of the broken link…and a piece of content from Backlinko that would be a 1:1 replacement: !Brian's email – Asked for mentioning SEO tools guide And most folks were more than happy to add my link: !Broken link building – Reply to Brian ## Case Study #3 ##### How Matt Built Links to His Ecommerce Site --- Let’s face it: Link building for ecommerce sites isn’t easy. But it’s possible. Just look at Matt Lawry. Like most ecommerce site owners, Matt had trouble building links to his ecommerce website. After all, who wants to link to a site made up of 100% product pages? That’s when Matt realized that he could use content to generate links to his ecommerce site. Specifically, Matt published an amazing piece of Skyscraper content on his site: “Australian Gin: The Ultimate Guide Of course, Matt didn’t sit back and wait for the links to roll in. He promoted his content via email outreach: !Mat's email outreach Because Matt reached out to the right people (and sent them personalized emails), many people OFFERED to link to his guide. !People offered to link to Mat's guide And all of these links boosted Matt’s ## **Chapter 8:**Advanced Link Building Tips !Advanced Link Building Tips Here’s a quick list of advanced link building tips that I’ve picked up over the years. ## Get Easy Links With Link Reclamation Whenever someone mentions your brand in an article, they link to you…*right*? Wrong. I mean, they *should* link to you. But it doesn’t always happen. Here’s what I mean: !( \"backlinko-mention-without-link\") But with a gentle nudge, most site owners are happy to turn your unlinked mention into a link. How do you find these unlinked mentions? BuzzSumo ## Get “Bonus” Links With Reverse Image Do you publish visual assets like infographics and charts? If so, there are probably sites using your images without attribution **right now**. Don’t freak out. In fact, you should celebrate. Just like with link reclamation, a friendly email can turn many of these opportunities into valuble links. And you can use Google reverse image ![Reverse image ## Send Emails In the Afternoon Here’s one thing I’ve learned from sending THOUSANDS of outreach emails: Send your outreach emails in the afternoon (in the recipient’s local time). Why? When you send your message in the morning, it gets lumped together with the 93 other emails that person has to deal with. But when you send in the afternoon, there’s much less competition in the inbox. I recommend Gmail’s built-in scheduling feature to help time your outreach emails: ![Afternoon Emails ## Create Visualizations of Concepts, Ideas and Strategies Here’s an example of this in action from Backlinko: !Backlinko Simple Visual Believe it or not, but lots of people have linked to me thanks to this simple illustration: !Backlinko visual reverse image Why does this work so well? Well I COULD have simply described the APP formula with text. But that would have made my content much less shareable. On the other hand, when you create a visual, you have something that bloggers will happily use in their content (and link to you when they do). ## Send Out Feeler Emails Before Going For the Close Should you ask for a link in your first outreach email to someone? Short answer: maybe. You may get better results with a two-step process (Backlinko reader [Mike: !Feeler Emails The other benefit of this approach is that it saves you TIME. Instead of personalizing outreach messages that no one will ever read, send brief “feeler” emails. Then personalize the heck out of your next series of messages. ## Get Interviewed on Podcasts Yes, guest post links have their place. But they have one big problem: they take a ton of time to write! Enter podcasting. Instead of outlining, drafting and editing a guest post, you just show up and talk about what you know. And – boom! — you get a link. The best part? There are podcasts on EVERY topic. Here’s an example of a link I built by appearing on a podcast: !Link built – Interviewed on podcast ## Use “Link Intersect” To Uncover Likely Linkers If someone links to your competitor, they’re likely to link to you…right? Right. And if someone links to TWO of your competitors, **they’re even more likely to link to you**. How can you find sites that links to more than one of your competitors? **Semrush Backlink Gap tool** Just list out 2-3 of your biggest competitors along with your website. And this nifty tool will show you who links to all of ‘em. !Backlink Gap – Prospects for – backlinko.com ## Use “Pre-Curated” Lists of Link Targets There’s no denying it: Finding high-quality link targets is HARD. That’s the bad news. The good news is that someone else already curated these high-quality sites for you… …in the form of “best blog” lists. Here’s an example: !Baking Blogs Needless to say, if you run a baking blog, every single one of the sites listed here would make a great link opportunity.
